# 1. Introduction

<br>
-   The cost of healthcare is going up everywhere, and it's a big problem for many countries. To help fix this, we need to know what makes medical expenses high. This is important for insurance companies, healthcare providers, and the government. The report looks at the "Medical Cost Personal Dataset." This dataset shows health insurance costs based on things like age, sex, BMI, smoking, and where people live. It has 1,338 records with 7 different factors that affect insurance costs. These factors include age, region, smoking habits, and BMI. The main focus is on "charges," which means the medical costs billed. The data comes from Kaggle.
The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset to find important patterns and relationships between different factors and medical costs. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, visualizations, and a prediction model to estimate medical expenses based on these factors. The findings could help insurance companies better understand individuals with high medical costs, which can support better risk management and adjust pricing strategies for premiums.
