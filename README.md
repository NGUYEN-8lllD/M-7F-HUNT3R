# I. Introduction


- The cost of healthcare is going up everywhere, and it's a big problem for many countries. To help fix this, we need to know what makes medical expenses high. This is important for insurance companies, healthcare providers, and the government. The report looks at the "Medical Cost Personal Dataset." This dataset shows health insurance costs based on things like age, sex, BMI, smoking, and where people live. It has 1,338 records with 7 different factors that affect insurance costs. These factors include age, region, smoking habits, and BMI. The main focus is on "charges," which means the medical costs billed. The data comes from Kaggle.
- The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset to find important patterns and relationships between different factors and medical costs. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, visualizations, and a prediction model to estimate medical expenses based on these factors. The findings could help insurance companies better understand individuals with high medical costs, which can support better risk management and adjust pricing strategies for premiums.

- This data can be instrumental for analyzing sales performance, understanding customer preferences, and making informed business decisions.

# IV. Charts and Insights
**1. Smoking vs. Medical Charges**
Smokers pay way more. The box plot shows smokers have much higher charges than non-smokers. Recommendation: charge smokers more.

**2. BMI Categories vs. Medical Charges**
People were grouped by BMI: underweight, normal, overweight, obese. The box plot shows obese people face higher charges. This means BMI is a good factor for predicting high costs.

**3. Age vs. Medical Charges**
Charges increase with age, especially after 50. The scatter plot shows this clearly. Older people are more likely to need higher-cost insurance.
These charts directly show who has higher costs—smokers, older people, and those with higher BMI. This means insurance companies should adjust premiums accordingly.

# V. Conclusion
Smoking, age, and BMI are the main factors driving medical costs. Smokers, older people, and those with high BMI should be charged higher premiums based on their risk. No fluff—just straight insights and recommendations.
