# I. Introduction



- Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are like the top reason people die worldwide, killing about 17.9 million people every year, which is 31% of all deaths. Out of these, like 4 out of 5 deaths are from heart attacks and strokes, and a third of them happen to people under 70, which is considered early. Heart failure is a usual problem caused by CVDs, and this dataset has 11 features to try to predict if someone might get heart disease.

- People who already have CVD or are at high risk‚Äîmaybe because they have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or already have the disease‚Äîneed to be detected early and managed. Using a machine learning model could help a lot in finding and handling these risks.

# IV. Charts and Insights
**1. Smoking vs. Medical Charges**
Smokers pay way more. The box plot shows smokers have much higher charges than non-smokers. Recommendation: charge smokers more.

<br>

**Chart Analysis: Smoking vs Medical Charges**


**Which One is Highest?**
- **Smokers** pay significantly higher medical charges than non-smokers. The median cost for smokers is around **$35,000**, while for non-smokers it's just **$8,000**. The highest costs for smokers go over **$60,000**, compared to non-smokers who rarely exceed **$20,000**.
**Increasing/Decreasing Pattern?**
- There's no specific increasing or decreasing trend shown here because this is a comparison between two groups. What it clearly shows is a **huge difference** in medical costs between smokers and non-smokers. Smokers always have higher costs‚Äîno exceptions.
**Why is This Important?**
<br>
**=>**  Smokers are a high-risk group with much higher and more unpredictable medical expenses. This means **higher premiums** are needed for smokers to balance out the increased risk. The cost difference is too big to ignore; smokers need to pay more because they cost the company more. Straightforward decision‚Äîcharge them more, minimize the company's financial risk.

**2. BMI Categories vs. Medical Charges**
People were grouped by BMI: underweight, normal, overweight, obese. The box plot shows obese people face higher charges. This means BMI is a good factor for predicting high costs.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec0abee4-7214-4d00-b007-54f89cced786)
<br>

**Chart Analysis: BMI Category vs Medical Charges**



**Which One is Highest?**
- **Obese** individuals have the highest medical charges. The median cost is higher than the other BMI categories, and there are many outliers with extremely high charges (some even exceeding **$60,000**).
- **Underweight, Normal, and Overweight** categories have similar median charges, all much lower than the obese group.
**Increasing/Decreasing Pattern?**
- There is an **increasing pattern** in medical charges as BMI goes up. Medical charges steadily rise from **underweight to obese**. Obese individuals have a significant jump in costs compared to the others.
**Why is This Important?**
<br>
**=>**  Obese individuals are driving higher costs, which means they are a higher risk group. To manage this risk, insurance premiums should be higher for obese individuals. The cost difference is clear‚Äîpeople with higher BMIs (specifically those classified as obese) cost more in healthcare. Adjust the premiums accordingly to make sure the higher risk (higher medical expenses) is covered by higher pricing. Simple decision‚Äîhigher risk, higher cost.

**3. Age vs. Medical Charges**
Charges increase with age, especially after 50. The scatter plot shows this clearly. Older people are more likely to need higher-cost insurance.
These charts directly show who has higher costs‚Äîsmokers, older people, and those with higher BMI. This means insurance companies should adjust premiums accordingly.

<br>

**Chart Analysis: Age vs Medical Charges**
</br>
<br>
**Which One is Highest?**
- **Smokers** always have the highest medical charges compared to non-smokers, regardless of age. The **blue dots** represent smokers, and they are consistently above the **orange dots** (non-smokers).
- As age increases, the medical charges also increase for both smokers and non-smokers, but smokers consistently pay much more. The highest charges go well above **$60,000**, mostly for older smokers.
**Increasing/Decreasing Pattern?**
- **Increasing Pattern**: Medical costs **increase with age**. The older the person, the more they pay, especially if they smoke. The charges rise for both groups, but the gap between smokers and non-smokers remains obvious and significant at every age group.
**Why is This Important?**
<br>
**=>**  Age and smoking are two major factors driving up medical costs. Older people cost more, and smokers cost way more. So, adjust the premiums‚Äîcharge **older people higher premiums** based on the increased cost with age, and **charge smokers even more** to cover their significantly higher health risks. The costs aren't the same for everyone‚Äîinsurance pricing needs to reflect this. Higher age and smoking mean higher costs, so premiums need to go up for these groups..
</br>

# V. Conclusion
Smoking, age, and BMI are the main factors driving medical costs. Smokers, older people, and those with high BMI should be charged higher premiums based on their risk. No fluff‚Äîjust straight insights and recommendations.
